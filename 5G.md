# 5G的三个方向：
1.  More device
2.  Higher Tput: 
3.  Lower latency: transmission over fraction of a slot; higher SCS; Dynamic TDD; Front loaded RS and control
signaling (这样decode的时间会减少); MAC/RLC support (在LTE时，知道要在什么时候传什么，但是在5G上却不知道接下来要传什么)

# 5G与4G的不同：
1.  加入了SDPA (service Data Application Protocol) Layer 在PDCP层之上，然后这样可以mapping service.
2.  FR1, FR2(Frequency Range): Sub6 与 mmWav的design
3.  High Band上，coverage就是一个很严重的问题。所以必须用beamform来解决这个问题 --> Beam Centric
4.  LTE 是一个always on的service，CRS是在不停的发送的。但是相应的5G上取消了这些。几乎没有always on的东西。
5.  SCS: higher SCS will have better phase noise resist but lower CP; lower SCS will have longer CR
but could be very sensitive to phase noise. 
    1.  240KHz is supported for SSB only.
6.  CORESETs vs LTE control channel: CORESETs only cover part of the carrier bandwidth; CORESETs have beamforming
7.  No PCFICH, PHICH in 5G
8.  Analog Beamforming vs digital beamforming: sharper Beams needed for higher frequency; beam sweep, beam tracking, 
beam recovery.
9.  PSS + SSS + PBCH = SSB in 5G. More sparse allocation, 20ms period vs 5ms period but cover more frequency.
10. RRC state machine:
    1.  RRC idle: No data transfer, No RRC context, no CN connection, device controlled mobility.
    2.  RRC inactive: No data transfer, RRC context available; CN connected; device controlled mobility
    3.  RRC connected: Data transfer available, RRC context available, CN connected, Network controlled mobility.
    4.  Target for inactive state introduce:
        1.  Reduced the idle -> connected state transition overhead.
        2.  Reduced the latency between idle -> connected state
        3.  NW think UE in connected state but UE think itself in idle state.
11. OFDM Uplink:
    1.   Problem for DFT-OFDM:
        1.  Not suitable for spatial multiplexing (only one layer supported compare to ODFM have 4 layers)
        2.  UL/DL decoding scheme is not the same.
        3.  V2X sidelink needed additional DFT OFDM receiver.
        4.  Must be contiguous allocation in frequency domain.
12. Basic timeTc = 1/ (480 K * 4096)
13. Time domain structure: Slot duration is changed.
    1.  10ms Frame, 1 ms SubFrame: same as LTE
    2.  14 OFDM symbol a slot. 
    3.  Reason: Use analog beamforming could result in one user per OFDM symbol, so increase the SCS to 
    reduce the time duration for each OFDM symbol. Then 1ms can still support multiple users.
14. Frequency domain structure: No DC subcarrier
    1.  LTE don't use DC subchannel because of local oscillator leakage and UE can cover 20MHz BW.
    2.  NR support up to 400MHz BW, UE can's cover the entire BW and find the center DC subchannel.
    3.  UE been signalled the location of point A as part of SIB1 and all RBs are relative to the reference point.
15. BWP:
    1.  对小的数据使用small BW来接受；对大的数据才打开整个BW来接收；故而需要BWP的概念。
    2.  Support up to 4 BWP.
16. Dynamic Slot format:
    1.  DL/UL/flexible.
    2.  Cell specified configuration; Device specified configuration; SFI in DL control.
    3.  SFI can't change the DL/UL, it can only change the flexible.
    4.  Slot format have all DL and all UL configuration because an SUL can be all UL so serving cell can be all DL.
17. Quasi-colocation.
