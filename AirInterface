1. SC FDMA: UL achieve lower Peak to Average Ratio.
2. 12 subcarrier and 14 symbols is 1 PRB
3. 1 subcarrier and 1 symbol is 1 RE.
4. REG is 4 -6 RE to carry control information
5. Alamuti code:
6. Only 1 - 2 codewords and 1 -4 layers. So there is an mapping.
7. Channels:
    PDSCH: User Plane data and dedicated signling
        Use the MCS info from PDCCH.
    PBCH: BW, SFN, PHICH config
        40ms, 4 OFDM symbol in second slot of subframe 0.
    PCFICH: UE control formate info (CFI) for DL control channel:
            Number of OFDM symbols used for PDCCH.
            first OFDM symbol of all subframe.
    PHICH: ACK/NACK for uplink
    PDCCH: DCI info.
        UL assignment; Format 0
        DL assignment: Format 1/2 MCS, RV,
            1A: PDSCH
            2: PDSCH with 2 codeword - closed loop SU MIMO
            2A: PDSCH with 2 codeword - open loop SU MIMO
        UL power control command: Format 3.
        paging indicator.
        paging indicator.
    CRS:
        Channel estimation for demodulation --> UE RS
        CQI, PMI and RI --> CSI RS and CRS
        Cell reselection and handover --> CRS
        For 2CRS, every 3 RE in frequency domain have one CRS port and it exist on symbol 0/4/7/11
        For 4CRS, CRS0/1 is same, CRS3/4 is extend only on symbol0/7
    PSS/SSS:
        subframe 0/5, two/one symbol before end of first slot on every frame
        PSS: subframe timing, exact carrier frequency, CP lenght
        SSS: frame timing, cell ID

8. TPC command:
    In DCI of PDCCH.

9. Contension Free/ based:
    Contention based is use a pre-defined preamble sequence and PRACH ID in the handover RRC message for RACH.
    if handover command don't have those info. Then we needed to do contention based.
